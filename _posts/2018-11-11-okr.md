 Objectives and key results(OKR) is a framework for defining and tracking objectives and their outcomes.
 It has been used by several major companies including Google, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Uber.
 The OKR framework aims to define company and team "objectives" along with linked and measurable "key results" to provide "a critical thinking framework
 and ongoing discipline that seeks to ensure employees work together, focusing their efforts to make measurable contributions."
 OKRs are typically set at the company, team and personal levels and may be shared across the organization with the intention of providing teams with
 visibility of goals with the intention to align and focus effort.
