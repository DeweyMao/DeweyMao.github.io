<p align="justify">
A debt binge has left a quarter of US corporate assets vulnerable to a sudden increase in interest rates, the International Monetary Fund has warned.
</p>
<p align="justify">
国际货币基金组织(IMF)警告，一场债务盛宴使得美国四分之一的公司资产易受利率突然上升的影响。
</p>
<p align="justify">
The ability of companies to cover interest payments is at its weakest since the 2008 financial crisis, according to one measure.
</p>
<p align="justify">
根据一个衡量标准，企业支付利息的能力处于自2008年金融危机以来最弱水平。
</p>
<p align="justify">
The IMF’s twice-yearly Global Financial Stability Report, released yesterday, highlighted what economists at the fund see as one of the main risks facing President Donald Trump and his plans to boost US growth through a combination of tax cuts and infrastructure spending.
</p>
<p align="justify">
IMF昨日发布半年度《全球金融稳定报告》(Global Financial Stability Report)，强调了该组织经济学家认为唐纳德•特朗普(Donald Trump)总统及其通过减税和基建支出来提振美国增长的计划所面对的主要风险之一。
</p>
<p align="justify">
Although Republican plans are far from finalised, the IMF’s assumption is that tax cuts will end up adding to both the US deficit and the country’s debt load, predicting it would be as much as 11 percentage points of gross domestic product larger in five years than they forecast a year ago.
</p>
<p align="justify">
尽管共和党的计划远未敲定，但IMF的假设是，减税将增加美国的赤字和债务负担，该组织预计，五年后美国的债务负担与国内生产总值(GDP)之比将比他们一年前的预测高出11个百分点。
</p>
<p align="justify">
But it is the potential impact of those plans on borrowing costs and companies that the IMF also finds concerning.
</p>
<p align="justify">
这还不算，那些计划对借款成本和企业的潜在冲击，也让IMF担忧。
</p>
<p align="justify">
Should Mr Trump’s plans lead to bigger budget deficits and higher inflation it would force the Federal Reserve to raise rates faster than expected. That could lead to a rapid appreciation in the dollar and consequences for emerging economies with as much as $230bn in vulnerable debt.
</p>
<p align="justify">
如果特朗普的计划导致更大的预算赤字和更高的通胀，那将迫使美联储(Federal Reserve)以快于预期的步伐加息。这可能导致美元迅速升值，对新兴经济体造成的后果将是高达2300亿美元的脆弱债务。
</p>
<p align="justify">
It would also have an impact on the borrowing costs of US companies, which the IMF says have added $7.8tn in debt and other liabilities since 2010.
</p>
<p align="justify">
这也将对美国企业的借款成本产生影响，IMF表示，自2010年以来，美国企业的债务和其他负债增加了7.8万亿美元。
</p>
<p align="justify">
The IMF warned that “corporate credit fundamentals [in the US] have started to weaken, creating conditions that have historically preceded a credit cycle downturn”. By the IMF’s calculations, companies with almost $4tn in assets — or 22 per cent of total US corporate assets — would be “weak” or “vulnerable” to a fiscal expansion that went wrong and led to a sharp rise in borrowing costs.
</p>
<p align="justify">
IMF警告，“美国的企业信贷基本面已经开始减弱，造成了在历史上预示信贷周期下行的条件”。根据IMF的计算，总计拥有近4万亿美元资产（占美国公司总资产的22%）的公司，在财政扩张酿成恶果、借款成本大幅上涨的情况下将会变得“薄弱”或“脆弱”。
</p>
<p align="justify">
Viewed as a whole, “the US corporate sector is healthy”, said Tobias Adrian, the IMF’s new financial stability watchdog. But “there is a tail of vulnerable firms in the corporate sector”.
</p>
<p align="justify">
IMF新设立的金融稳定监督员托比亚斯•阿德里亚(Tobias Adrian)表示，从整体上看，“美国企业部门是健康的”。但是“企业部门存在一个脆弱企业长尾”。
</p>
<p align="justify">
While the absolute level of debt servicing costs as a proportion of income was low compared with that during the financial crisis, other measures were less encouraging. Average interest coverage has fallen sharply, the IMF said, with earnings less than six times the cost of interest, a figure “close to the weakest multiple” since the start of the crisis.
</p>
<p align="justify">
虽然与金融危机期间相比，偿债成本的绝对水平与盈利之比仍然较低，但其他衡量标准的结果不那么令人鼓舞。IMF表示，利息保障倍数的平均值已大幅下滑，息税前利润不到利息费用的6倍，接近自危机爆发以来“最弱的倍数”。
</p>
<p align="justify">
Already, the IMF said, companies accounting for 10 per cent of corporate assets appear unable to cover interest payments out of current earnings.
</p>
<p align="justify">
IMF表示，已经有占公司总资产10%的企业似乎无力用当前盈利来覆盖利息支出。
</p>
<p align="justify">
Many were in the energy sector and suffering due to the oil price volatility. “But the proportion of challenged firms has broadened across such other industries as real estate and utilities,” IMF economists wrote.
</p>
<p align="justify">
其中很多公司在能源行业，它们遭受石油价格波动的打击。“但是，受挑战企业的比例已经扩大，像房地产和公用事业这样的其他行业也被卷入，”IMF经济学家们写道。
</p>
<p align="justify">
The warning came alongside what was otherwise a relatively cheery assessment of the broad state of global financial stability.
</p>
<p align="justify">
发出这一警告的同时，IMF对全球金融稳定的整体状况做出了相对乐观的评估。
</p>
