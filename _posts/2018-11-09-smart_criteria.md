SMART criteria is a mnemonic acronym, giving criteria to guide in the objectives, for example in project management, employee-performance management and personal management.

### Specific
Your goal should be clear and specific, otherwise you won't be able to focus your efforts or feel truly motivated to achieve it. When drafting your goal, try to answer the 
five "W" questions:
- What do I want to accomplish?
- Why is this goal important?
- Who is involved?
- Where is it located?
- Which resources or limits are involved?

### Measurable
It's important to have measurable goals, so that you can track your proggress and stay motivated. Assessing progress helps you to stay focused, meet your deadlines, and feel 
the excitement of getting closer to achieving your goal. A measurable goal should address questions sunch as:
- How much?
- How many?
- How will I know when it is accomplished?

### Achievable
Your goal also needs to be realistic and attainable to be successful. In other words, it should stretch your abilities but still remain possible. When you set an achievable 
goal, you may be able to identify previous overlooked opportunities or resources that can bring you closer to it. An achievable goal will usually anser questions such as:
- How can I accomplish this goal?
- How realistic is the goal, based on other constrains, such as financial factors?

### Relevant 
This step is about ensuring that your goal matters to you, and that it also aligns with other relevant goals. We all need support and assistance in 
achieving our goals, but it's important to retain control over them. So, make sure that your plans drive everyone forward, but that you're still  
responsible for achieving your own goal. A relevent goal can answer "yes" to these questions:
- Does this seem worthwhile?
- Is this the right time?
- Does this match our other efforts?
- Am I the right person to reach this gaol?
- Is it applicable in the current socio-economic environment?

### Time-bound
Every goal needs a target date, so that you have a deadline to focus on and something to work toward. This part of the SMART goal criteria helps to 
prevent everyday tasks from taking priority over your longer-term goals. A time-bound goal will usually answer these questions:
- When?
- What can I do six months from now?
- What can I do six weeks from now?
- What can I do today?
