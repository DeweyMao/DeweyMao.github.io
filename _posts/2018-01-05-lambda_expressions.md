In C++11 and later, a lambda expression often called a lambda, is a convenient way of defining an anonymous function object (a closure) right at the location where it is invoked or passed as an argument to a function. 
Typically lambdas are used to encapsulate a few lines of code that are passed to algorithms or asynchronous methods.
